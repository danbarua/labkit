# 004: npm-era config cruft cleared, and the consumer-contract protocol built

**Session wrap, 2026-08-20, on `feat/domain-consumer`.** Not a decision record —
see `docs/project-journal/023_capture_cheaply_promote_before_citing.md` for why
a consumer is the next probe, and `docs/consumer-contract/001_design_brief.md`
for the protocol itself. First entry written from the `labkit-domain-consumer`
worktree.

## Goal

Clear "the old js .json config hell cruft" and the dead allow-install entries,
then draft the brief for the cold-context designers PJ-023 called for — and act
on the external review of that brief.

## Changed

Six commits, all this session, range clean — no other session's work in it.

**Config hygiene** (`9109790`, `1631f3c`). Deleted `package-lock.json` (3,188
tracked lines) and ignored it; re-locked drizzle-kit to 0.30.6; removed the whole
`allowScripts` block.

*One `npm install` explains all of it.* Someone bumped `package.json` to
`^0.30.6` and ran **npm** — updating `package-lock.json` and adding
`allowScripts` entries for the tree npm resolved — and never ran `bun install`.
So `bun.lock` stayed at 0.18.1 (violating `package.json`'s own range), the
`es5-ext@0.10.64` entry went stale, and the block described a tree bun had never
built. Not three oversights, one install with the wrong tool. `allowScripts`
turned out **wholly** dead, not one line stale: it is `@lavamoat/allow-scripts`'
field and lavamoat is not installed; bun's equivalent is `trustedDependencies`
(`node_modules/bun-types/bun.d.ts:9402`), never used here.

Nothing else at the root was cruft, checked rather than assumed:
`docker-compose.yml` is live (the real-AGE reference platform for the
postgres-age skill and `examples/full-lifecycle.md`), `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`
and `drizzle.config.ts` back their scripts, `drizzle/meta/*.json` is
drizzle-kit's journal, and all four `scripts/` targets exist.

**Consumer-contract protocol** (`d54e920` then `4ed03ef`). Revision 1 went to
external review before running and was rebuilt. Four pre-run defects, recorded
in the brief rather than quietly fixed:

1. The reading bar was **circular** — the probe finds what the model cannot
   express, under a rule saying inability to express earns nothing. Now three
   bars: an unavailable answer earns a *candidate*; a paired-world test promotes
   it to evidence when two states the contract must distinguish are identical in
   durable state; survivors meet the unchanged change bar.
2. The withholding line **leaked more than admitted**. Revision 1 called PJ-008
   §1 "researcher language, written before any model existed" — false. Verified:
   story 9's gloss names `Artefact`/`Evidence`/`Question`/`Decision` and
   `RecoveredArtefact`, story 12's argues Evidence and Claim are separate, and
   §1's closing "The shape these describe" is a process diagram in the
   ontology's own terms (that third one the review missed; checking found it).
   The **bold sentences alone are clean — zero backticked terms across all
   eighteen**, which is what Stage A now uses.
3. The instrument was **lexical and disclosed**. Now an undifferentiated
   glossary of every concept, supplied or introduced, whose load-bearing field
   is what two situations become indistinguishable without it.
4. Predictions **bundled interpretation**, rested on contaminated input, or were
   unfalsifiable. Now a preregistered H1/H0 with the rest demoted to secondary,
   each with an explicit falsifier.

Also added: the two-stage reveal (`002` Stage A, `003` Stage B), which is what
makes the second measurement possible — which concepts came from researchers'
words versus only after LabKit's design vocabulary was supplied. Panel claim
softened from independence to triangulation; scope corrected to precursor, not
the consumer PJ-023 asked for.

Working tree clean. `4ed03ef` is ahead of `origin/feat/domain-consumer`.

## Verified

Code verification ran on `1631f3c`, the last commit touching code. The four
later commits are documentation only.

- `bun test` → **188 pass, 0 fail**, 611 expect() calls, 20 files, 77.14s.
- `bun run typecheck` → clean.
- `npx depcruise src tests --output-type err` → **0 errors**, 2 orphan warnings
  (`src/index.ts`, `src/cli.ts`, both known stubs).
- `bun run check:migrations` → OK.
- `node_modules/.bin/drizzle-kit --version` → v0.30.6, executes.
- Deletion-verify on `allowScripts`: removed the block, `bun install`, esbuild
  0.19.12 still present and its binary still runs.
- Leak audit for the Stage A packet: grep over PJ-008 §1 for backticked and
  ontology terms — 3 hits, all in glosses or the closing section, 0 in the
  eighteen bold sentences.

Not run: `bun examples/full-lifecycle.ts`.

**Why the combined code run mattered.** The two sessions had each verified one
half against the other's stale side — the review session tested the new lockfile
with the old `package.json`, this one the new `package.json` with the old
lockfile. Both results true; neither covered what shipped. That failure mode is
*created* by clean division of labour, not prevented by it, and separate
worktrees make it easier to fall into.

## Open

- **No designer has been run.** The protocol is committed and unexecuted, which
  is the intended state — predictions before results.
- **Panel composition undecided.** Needs the list of model families `omp` is
  authenticated for. The llmtrim subagent types were proxy cruft and are gone;
  `omp-headless` is the route.
- **I deleted my own wrap state file.** Clearing the 18 foreign state files the
  worktree inherited, I picked "mine" from the newest transcript in the
  worktree's project dir (`4657ab2a…`) and kept that. The Stop hook then passed
  `be5374e7…` — this session kept its id across the move. The hook recreated it
  with a correct baseline, so the outcome was benign, but the reasoning was
  wrong: **the hook's argument is the authority on the session id, not the
  transcript directory.**
- `package-lock.json` is **still tracked on `main`** and arrives there when this
  branch merges. Correct under the docs-on-`main` / code-on-branch split.
- This branch is 1 behind `main` (`3c44e01`, a session-log entry).

## Next

`git push`, then Stage A: run three designers on
`docs/consumer-contract/002_stage_a_packet.md` — that file is the complete
input, nothing else — and commit their outputs verbatim as `010`, `011`, `012`
**before** reading across them. `003_stage_b_packet.md` stays sealed until then;
revealing it early destroys the ablation permanently.
